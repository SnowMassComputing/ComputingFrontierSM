\section{Networking}


Particle physics research in all areas depends on the availability of reliable, high-bandwidth, feature-rich computer networks for interconnecting instruments and computing centers globally. Most particle physics-related data is transported by National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), supplemented by infrastructures dedicated to specific projects. NRENs differ from commercial networks, because they are optimized for transporting massive data flows generated by large-scale scientific collaborations. In addition, NRENs offer advanced capabilities --- such as multi-domain dedicated circuits --- which commercial providers do not have an incentive to deploy.

For decades, network traffic generated by particle physics has been a primary driver of NREN growth, and particle physics requirements have motivated NREN architectures and research activities. In the next ten years and beyond, the productivity of particle physics collaborations will continue to depend on an ecosystem of innovative global NRENs. 

Particle physics collaborations are now accustomed to viewing network transport as a reliable and predictable resource,  so much so that data models for ATLAS and CMS have evolved rapidly in response to NREN capabilities, but this state of affairs is not inevitable. Other data-intensive communities have begun to generate large traffic flows and, following the example of particle physics, to incorporate high-performance networks into science workflows. As a result of this broad trend toward data intensity across many disciplines, NRENs around the world will be challenged to meet the requirements of large-scale research, and must be adequately provisioned in order to continue serving the critical role they have played in the past.  

In support of our objectives through 2020, basic and applied networking research is necessary in a range of subjects. Critical questions include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item What future architectures will maximize utilization and minimize cost in core and campus networks?
\item How can emerging paradigms such as Software Defined Networking or Named Data Networking be harnessed most effectively to improve particle physics science outcomes?
\item Can networks evolve into adaptive, self-organizing, programmable systems that quickly respond to requests of particle physics science applications? 
\item If well-tuned host systems (or ensembles of them) have the ability to saturate a single backbone channel, what techniques and architectures can NRENs adopt to maximize data mobility?
\item How will the emerging “complexity challenge” arising from closer integration between networks and applications be managed, especially in the multi-domain, multi-national context?
\item How can diverse networks cooperate – automatically and securely – to offer science-optimized capabilities on a worldwide basis? 
\item Can discovery or automation techniques reduce the need for fragile, manual configuration? 
\item How will networks respond to the operational challenge of deploying  and managing dozens of wavelengths across large geographies under relatively flat funding prospects? 
\item Will post-TCP protocols become useful outside of highly-controlled demonstration projects? 
\item Would computer modeling of applications, networks, and data flows be useful in answering any of these questions?  
\item Will power consumption become a limiting economic or operational factor in this time period? 
\end{itemize}

Recent investments in network research have been insufficient.  Continued underfunding will compromise the ability of particle physics collaborations to maximize scientific productivity. Increased research funding, while necessary, is not sufficient; there also needs to be increased attention to the process of translating the results of network research into real-world architectures that NRENs can deploy and manage. Incentives and funding for such activities that enable deployment
are urgently needed. Because network research has now begun to intersect with research in services and applications, cross-disciplinary funding opportunities should also be available.  

A number of cultural and operational practices need to be overcome in order for NRENs (and global cyber-infrastructures more generally) to fully succeed. 
Expectations for network performance must be raised significantly, so that collaborations do not continue to design workflows around a historical impression of what is possible. 
The gap between peak and average transfer rates must be closed. 
Campuses must deploy secure science data enclaves – --- or  Science DMZs \cite{DMZ} – --- engineered for the needs of particle physics and other data-intensive disciplines.  Fortunately, each of these trends is currently underway, but momentum must be accelerated.   

Ten years from now, the key applications on which particle physics depends will only be fully successful, efficient, or cost-effective if they are run on the networks that exist today. 
During the next decade, research networks need to evolve into programmable instruments – --- flexible resources that can be customized for particular needs, but that exist within a common, integrated, ubiquitous framework that is reliable, robust and trusted for its privacy and integrity. These are major challenges, but they are tractable if funding agencies invest in innovative research, and maintain support for the exponential growth of NREN traffic.
